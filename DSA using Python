# LeetCode-Python-Queqtions
Q.1)Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
Sol.1) class Solution(object):
  def twoSum(self, nums, target):
		
        result_list = []
		#Two for loops for selecting two numbers and check sum equal to target or not
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
			#  j from i + 1; no need to check back elements it covers in i
			# Check sum == target or not
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    result_list.append(i)

Q16)1656. Design an Ordered Stream
There is a stream of n (idKey, value) pairs arriving in an arbitrary order, where idKey is an integer between 1 and n and value is a string. No two pairs have the same id.
Design a stream that returns the values in increasing order of their IDs by returning a chunk (list) of values after each insertion. The concatenation of all the chunks should result in a list of the sorted values.
Implement the OrderedStream class:
OrderedStream(int n) Constructs the stream to take n values.
String[] insert(int idKey, String value) Inserts the pair (idKey, value) into the stream, then returns the largest possible chunk of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.
Example:
Input
["OrderedStream", "insert", "insert", "insert", "insert", "insert"]
[[5], [3, "ccccc"], [1, "aaaaa"], [2, "bbbbb"], [5, "eeeee"], [4, "ddddd"]]
Output
[null, [], ["aaaaa"], ["bbbbb", "ccccc"], [], ["ddddd", "eeeee"]]
Explanation
// Note that the values ordered by ID is ["aaaaa", "bbbbb", "ccccc", "ddddd", "eeeee"].
OrderedStream os = new OrderedStream(5);
os.insert(3, "ccccc"); // Inserts (3, "ccccc"), returns [].
os.insert(1, "aaaaa"); // Inserts (1, "aaaaa"), returns ["aaaaa"].
os.insert(2, "bbbbb"); // Inserts (2, "bbbbb"), returns ["bbbbb", "ccccc"].
os.insert(5, "eeeee"); // Inserts (5, "eeeee"), returns [].
os.insert(4, "ddddd"); // Inserts (4, "ddddd"), returns ["ddddd", "eeeee"].
// Concatentating all the chunks returned:
// [] + ["aaaaa"] + ["bbbbb", "ccccc"] + [] + ["ddddd", "eeeee"] = ["aaaaa", "bbbbb", "ccccc", "ddddd", "eeeee"]
// The resulting order is the same as the order above.

Q21)804. Unique Morse Code Words
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:
'a' maps to ".-",
'b' maps to "-...",
'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.
For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Given an array of strings words where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.
For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", which is the concatenation of "-.-.", ".-", and "-...". We will call such a concatenation the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.
Example 1:
Input: words = ["gin","zen","gig","msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

Q32)1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points
On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.
You can move according to these rules:
In 1 second, you can either:
move vertically by one unit,
move horizontally by one unit, or
move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.
Example 1:

Q39)1827. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing
You are given an integer array nums (0-indexed). In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.
For example, if nums = [1,2,3], you can choose to increment nums[1] to make nums = [1,3,3].
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make nums strictly increasing.
An array nums is strictly increasing if nums[i] < nums[i+1] for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1. An array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can do the following operations:
1) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,1,2].
2) Increment nums[1], so nums becomes [1,2,2].
3) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,2,3].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,2,4,1]
Output: 14
