# LeetCode-Python-Queqtions
Q.1)Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
Sol.1) class Solution(object):
  def twoSum(self, nums, target):
		
        result_list = []
		#Two for loops for selecting two numbers and check sum equal to target or not
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
			#  j from i + 1; no need to check back elements it covers in i
			# Check sum == target or not
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    result_list.append(i)
                    result_list.append(j)

        return result_list
